# Computer Parts Store (Admin Page)

## This is the Admin Page for a fictional computer parts store where the product inventory can be managed.

## ðŸ›  To run locally:

1. Clone this repository using your Terminal (Mac and Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DakotaRileyMedia/computer-parts-store-admin.git
```

2. Install the LTS version of NodeJS for your machine at https://nodejs.org/en.

3. Once NodeJS has installed, exit your Terminal or Command Prompt so the NodeJS CLI can start to work.

4. Reopen your Terminal or Command Prompt and use it to move into the directory with the product. Replace "path" with the path where you cloned the project.

```sh
   cd "path"/computer-parts-store-admin/
```

5. Once inside of the directory, we need to install all of our node pagages using npm.

```sh
   npm install
```

6. To start the project, use npm to start the webserver.

```sh
   npm start
```

7. Now that our webserver has started running, go to your browser and type http://localhost:3000/ in the address bar to visit the project.
